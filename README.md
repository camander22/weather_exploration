	Visualizations can be a great tool to help determine what you should explore in your data, or possibly what statistical tests you should perform. 
For my first two visualizations, I showed the average monthly precipitation by city for the year 2014-2015 and the average monthly precipitation by city
historically. When comparing the visualizations, we can look for differences that we might want to explore next. For example, 
it appears that Houston had a lot more rain than they historically do, so that might suggest we run a T-test to see if the difference is statistically significant. 
	I conducted a T-test to compare Houston’s precipitation in 2014-2015 to Houston’s average precipitation for years past. However, I was unable to reject the
null hypothesis, thus concluding that 2014-2015’s precipitation in Houston was not significantly different than their average precipitation historically. 
	Next, I wanted to explore which cities had the most hot days, the most freezing days, and the most days with precipitation. This would be something I would
be interested in if I were planning to visit or move to any of these cities. I found that Phoenix, followed by Jacksonville and Houston had the highest percentages
of days over 85 degrees in 2014-2015. Indianapolis, followed by Chicago had the highest percentages of freezing days in 2014-2015, and Indianapolis, Seattle and 
Houston had the highest percentages of days with precipitation in 2014-2015.
